/*
3. An array is defined to be complete if all its elements are greater than 0 and all even numbers that are less than the maximum even number are in the array.
For example {2, 3, 2, 4, 11, 6, 10, 9, 8} is complete because
  
a. all its elements are greater than 0
b. the maximum even integer is 10
c. all even numbers that are less than 10 (2, 4, 6, 8) are in the array.

But {2, 3, 3, 6} is not complete because the even number 4 is missing. {2, -3, 4, 3, 6} is not complete because it contains a negative number.
Write a function named isComplete that returns 1 if its array argument is a complete array. Otherwise it returns 0.
The function signature is int isComplete (int[ ] a)
