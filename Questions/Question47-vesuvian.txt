A number n is vesuvian if it is the sum of two different pairs of squares. 
For example, 50 is vesuvian because 50 == 25 + 25 and 1 + 49. 
The numbers 65 (1+64, 16+49) and 85 (4+81, 36+49) are also vesuvian. 
789 of the first 10,000 integers are vesuvian.

Write a function named isVesuvian that returns 1 if its parameter is a vesuvian number, otherwise it returns 0. 
Hint: be sure to verify that your function detects that 50 is a vesuvian number!
