A hodder number is one that is prime and is equal to 2^j -1 for some j. 
For example, 31 is a hodder number because 31 is prime and is equal to 2^5 -1 (in this case j = 5). 
The first 4 hodder numbers are 3, 7, 31, 127

Write a function with signature 
int isHodder(int n) that returns 1 if n is a hodder number, otherwise it returns 0.

Recall that a prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two whole number factors, itself and 1.
