The Fibonacci sequence of numbers is 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,.... The fist and second numbers are 1 and after that 
ni = ni-2 + ni-1, e.g., 34 = 13 + 21. 

Write a method with signature int isFibonacci(int n) which returns 1 if its argument is a number in the 
Fibonacci sequence, otherwise it returns 0. 

For example, isFibonacci(13) returns a 1 and isFibonacci(27) returns a 0. 

Your solution must not use recursion because unless you cache the Fibonacci numbers as you find them, 
the recursive solution recomputes the same Fibonacci number many times.
